\maketheorem{Vector Blade dot and wedge product relations.}{thm:bladeDotWedgeSymmetryIdentities:180}{
Given a k-blade \( B \) and a vector \( \Ba \), the dot and wedge products have the following commutation relationships

\boxedEquation{eqn:bladeDotWedgeSymmetryIdentities:200}{
\begin{aligned}
\Ba \cdot B &= (-1)^{k-1} B \cdot \Ba \\
\Ba \wedge B &= (-1)^k B \wedge \Ba,
\end{aligned}
}

and can be expressed as symmetric and antisymmetric sums depending on the grade of the blade

\boxedEquation{eqn:bladeDotWedgeSymmetryIdentities:220}{
\begin{aligned}
B \wedge \Ba &= \inv{2}\lr{ B \Ba + (-1)^k \Ba B } \\
B \cdot \Ba &= \inv{2}\lr{ B \Ba - (-1)^k \Ba B }.
\end{aligned}
}
