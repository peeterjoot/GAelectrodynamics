Given curvilinear coordinates defined on a subspace \cref{dfn:curvilinearThree:280}, we don't have enough parameters to define the gradient.  For calculus on the k-dimensional subspace, we define the vector derivative

\index{vector derivative}
\index{\(\boldpartial\)}
\input{Definition_vector_derivative.tex}

When the dimension of the subspace (number of parameters) equals the dimension of the underlying vector space, the vector derivative equals the gradient.  Otherwise we can write
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:vectorDerivative:101}
\spacegrad = \boldpartial + \spacegrad_\perp,
\end{dmath}
and can think of the vector derivative as the projection of the gradient onto the tangent space at the point of evaluation.

Please see \citep{aMacdonaldVAGC} for an excellent introduction of the reciprocal frame, the gradient, and the vector derivative, and for
details about the connectivity of the manifold ignored here.
