\index{complex imaginary}
\index{pseudoscalar}

Using the reversion operation it is simple to show that the \R{3} pseudoscalar
behaves like a complex imaginary with \( I^2 = -1 \)

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:R3PseudoscalarSquare:3310}
I^2
=
I (-I^\dagger)
=
-
(\Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3)(\Be_3 \Be_2 \Be_1)
=
-
\Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_2 \Be_1
=
-
\Be_1 \Be_1
=
-1.
\end{dmath}
