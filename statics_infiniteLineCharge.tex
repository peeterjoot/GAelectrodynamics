Given a static line charge density and current density along the z-axis

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:statics_infiniteLineCharge:120}
\begin{aligned}
\rho(\Bx) &= \lambda \delta(x) \delta(y) \\
\BJ(\Bx) &= \Bv \rho(\Bx) = v \lambda \Be_3 \delta(x) \delta(y),
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

the total multivector current is
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:statics_infiniteLineCharge:140}
J
= \eta ( c \rho - \BJ )
= \eta ( c - v \Be_3 ) \lambda \delta(x) \delta(y)
= \frac{\lambda}{\epsilon} \lr{ 1 - \frac{v}{c} \Be_3 } \delta(x) \delta(y)
\end{dmath}

We can find the field for this current by substitution into \cref{eqn:statics:80}.
To do so, let the field observation point be \( \Bx = \Bx_\perp + z \Be_3 \), so the total field is
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:statics_infiniteLineCharge:160}
F(\Bx)
= \frac{\lambda}{4\pi \epsilon} \int_V dx'dy'dz' \frac{\gpgrade{(\Bx - \Bx') (1 - (v/c) \Be_3 )}{1,2}}{\Norm{\Bx - \Bx'}^3} \delta(x') \delta(y')
= \frac{\lambda}{4\pi \epsilon} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dz' \frac{\gpgrade{(\Bx_\perp + (z - z') \Be_3) (1 - (v/c) \Be_3 )}{1,2}}{\lr{\Bx_\perp^2 + (z-z')^2}^{3/2}}
=
\frac{\lambda \lr{ \Bx_\perp - (v/c) \Bx_\perp \Be_3}}{4\pi \epsilon} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{dz'}{\lr{\Bx_\perp^2 + (z-z')^2}^{3/2}}
+
\frac{\lambda \Be_3}{4\pi \epsilon} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{(z - z') dz'}{\lr{\Bx_\perp^2 + (z-z')^2}^{3/2}}.
\end{dmath}

The first integral is \( 2/\Bx_\perp^2 \), whereas the second is zero (odd function, over even interval).
Using cylindrical coordinates \( \Bx = R \rhocap + z \Be_3 \), and since
\( \Bx_\perp \cdot \Be_3 = 0 \), the wedge can be replaced with the vector product \( \Bx_\perp \Be_3 = R \rhocap \Be_3 \), leaving

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:statics_infiniteLineCharge:180}
F(\Bx)
=
\frac{\lambda}{2\pi \epsilon R} \rhocap \lr{ 1 - \Bv/c} = \BE \lr{ 1 - \Bv/c }
= \BE + I \lr{ \frac{\Bv}{c} \cross \BE },
\end{equation}

where \( \Bv = v \Be_3 \).
The vector component of this is the electric field, which is therefore directed radially, whereas the (dual) magnetic field \( \eta I \BH \)
is a set of oriented planes spanning the radial and z-axis directions.
We can also see that there is a constant proportionality factor that relates the electric and magnetic field components, namely

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:statics_infiniteLineCharge:200}
I \eta \BH = -\BE \Bv/c,
\end{dmath}

or

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:statics_infiniteLineCharge:220}
\BH = \Bv \cross \BD.
\end{dmath}
