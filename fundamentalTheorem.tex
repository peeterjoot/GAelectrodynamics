\index{fundamental theorem of geometric calculus}

The fundamental theorem of geometric calculus is a generalization of many conventional scalar and vector integral theorems, and relates a hypervolume integral to its boundary.
This is a a powerful theorem, which we will use with Green's functions to solve Maxwell's equation, but also to derive the geometric algebra form of Stokes' theorem, from which most of the familiar integral calculus results follow.
\input{Theorem_fundamental_theorem_of_gc.tex}
The geometry of the hypersurface element \( d^{k-1} \Bx \) will be made more clear when we
consider the specific cases of \( k = 1, 2, 3 \), representing generalized line, surface, and volume integrals respectively.
Instead of terrorizing the reader with a general proof
\cref{thm:fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus:1},
which requires some unpleasant index gymnastics,
this book
will separately state and prove the fundamental theorem of calculus
for each of the \( k = 1, 2, 3 \) cases that are of interest for problems in \R{2} and \R{3}.
For the interested reader, a sketch of the general proof
of \cref{thm:fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus:1}
is available in \cref{chap:gagcProof}.

Before moving on to the line, surface, and volume integral cases, we will state and prove the
general Stokes' theorem in its geometric algebra form.
