   - incorporate parts of lineAndPlane.tex into chapter 1 (summary portion as theorems, with extra details as problems).
   - Add table at the end summarizing the GA vs conventional forms.

   Have d^3 \Bx image with the fundamental theorem for volume integrals.  It should be moved from

   Do the same for surfaceintegral.tex.

- get rid of example block:

  Example 1.4: Multivector dot products.

- On the possibility of removing (1.67) : Mo:

   I think you should keep the definition of reverses and blade. In a book you do not have to use (later) every thing you define.
   Also a student may hear the term blade or reverse and may want to check the book to see what these refer to.
   So, in my opinion, removing these terms and definitions can do more harm than having it, which only will slightly increase the length of the book.
   Actually Eq. (1.67) is a very nice application of reverse, worth keeping.

- Manfred:

      For example, in Euclidean spaces we could use either of

      (1.69)
      i = (u ^ v)/sqrt(...)
      i = (u ^ v ^ w)/sqrt(...)

   => don't use i for both bivector and trivector pseudoscalar.

- didn't prove:

   Conversely, if the product of two vectors is a bivector, those vectors are orthogonal.

- Mo's marked up GA Chp1.pdf

   comments dealt with up to pg <= 36.

- define k-vector dot product.  multivector dot product will then just follow by superposition.  Same for the generalized wedge.

- mo:
   define the reverse of a k-vector, and then expand this to the reverse of a multivector.

- re: blades and reverse.
Mo suggested highlighting the fact that e_123^2 = -1, and e12^2 = -1 much earlier (presenting both as theorems).  Once that is done I probably won’t use that reverse formula, and will see if I even need it in the book.  I’m actually using blade for almost nothing now in the book (having switched to bivector since the distinction didn’t matter in many places).  Really the only place that it is left is chapter II where it was relevant for the generalized Stokes theorem.  Perhaps I can eliminate it entirely?

   4) audit all definitions, to ensure there are examples.

   6) make i = e1 e2, i^2 = -1 a theorem with proof to make stand out.

      handle sequencing issues.

   7) make I = e1 e2 e3, I^2 = -1 a theorem ...

   8) figure 1.7: change from e1,e2 to u, v, with u and v orthogonal, but different lengths.

   9) Figure 1.11: Rotation in a plane.

      x e^{i theta} = e^{-i \theta} x, provided x lies in the plane of the bivector i, so you can get a rotation with the opposite sense of x e^{i theta} with e^{i theta} x.  I'll add a note to try to clarify this, but think the label in the figure should be x e^{-i theta}.

   [figure adjusted, but not in this way (at least yet)].

   10) We can show that these unit vectors are orthogonal easily (eq 1.32)

      >> why grade selection.

         It looks like I haven't shown yet that the dot product is equivalent to grade 0 selection.

> point of new 1.3 vs. 1.4 figures.

The proposed 1.3 and 1.4 illustrate the same areas, with the same orientation.  Part of the point was to illustrate orientation, but the other point was to show that there is no preferred geometric representation of a bivector.  Any closed figures with the same orientation and total area are equally valid representations of a given bivector.

12)

> On multi-vector vs. k-vector  (your comment on page 13), indeed this was one of my upcoming questions which caused me some confusion. It seems to me that when you say multi-vector you mean a superposition of k-vectors that can have mixed Grades. For example 1+e1+ e12, +e123  is a multi-vector. But when you say k-vector even though this can also be a superposition, but all constituents have the same grade, for example e123 + 3e231 -e321. Am I correct? If so please make the distinction clear in the text and the best way to do so is to give examples.

> I asked a version if this question in my email thus morning. Here is a more specific version of it.
For example when you write bivecotor you can have superposition of bivectors but grade is 2 and only 2 (no scalar, trivector,... k-vector)
when you write trivecotor you can have superposition of trivectors but grade is 3 and only 3.
Similarly for k-vector.
However when you write multivector you mean superpositions of scalar, vector, bivector, ...k-vector. That is to say that the grade depends on which term you look at.

A: Your comment on multivector vs. k-vector is exactly correct.  A k-vector, say, k=2, has only grade 2 (examples: e1 e2, or e1 e3 + e2 e3), whereas a multivector may have any grade.  Any k-vector is also a multivector.  I'll add more examples to make this clearer.

13)

      When you say vector almost always you mean 1-vector correct?
      Here is my jargons, see if I am correct.
      0-vector = scalar
      1-vector = vector (traditional vector)
      2-vector = bivector
      3-vector = trivector
      ..
      So for example your entire discussion in section 1.8 is about the product of two 1-vectors, leading to a dot product and wedge product of two 1-vector, correct?

      Dot product can be defined for the product of two multivector (and hence two 1-vector), correct? However, wedge product is always between two 1-vector and has the grade 2?

      in product ab, (no dot or wedge between a and b) can a and b be two multi-vectors?


Clarify.  My answers:

         Yes, a 1-vector a traditional vector.  I tend not to write 1-vector, since I don't think that adds anything.


         > So for example your entire discussion in section 1.8 is about the product of two 1-vectors, leading to a dot product and wedge product of two 1-vector, correct?

         Yes.

         > Dot product can be defined for the product of two multivector (and hence two 1-vector), correct?

         Correct.

         > However, wedge product is always between two 1-vector and has the grade 2?

         Yes.  The wedge product of two vectors (1-vectors) a, b is defined as the grade 2 selection of the product a b (which can only have grade 2).

         > in product ab, (no dot or wedge between a and b) can a and b be two multi-vectors?


         Yes.  Maxwell's equation is an example of such a product.  It has the form

         (gradient + (1/c)partial_t)(E + I eta H) = J

         The gradient is a vector, and the time partial is a scalar, so that sum is a multivector with grades 0 and 1.
         The electric field is a vector, but I H is a bivector, so E + I eta H is a multivector with grades 1 and 2.

14) Is use of * for duality opertaion common?  In my opinion it only can cause confusion.

Yes, especially in differential forms.  I don’t use it in the book, but thought it worth mentioning for the reader who had seen duality in another context.  I’ll remove this from the definition, but may still mention it in the comments or a footnote following the definition.

15) Definition 1.23: Dual

"follow this with an example. In fact, you already have the example in the form of I e_3 e_(1= -) e_2. You just need to state it as an example. "

- re-implement \makeexample using \newtcolorbox for consistency.  They have different border widths and thicknesses.

- In the report I made some notes about the limitations of my geometric calculus treatment.  These should be
  incorporated into the text.  There is also an interesting point in Spivak's manifolds about triangularization
  which is of interest given MacDonald's paper on the same for blades.

   F &= -j \omega \eta I \lr{ 1 + \rcap } \lr{ \rcap \wedge \BF }.

   dimensions of [eta \BF] should equal [c \BA], but do not here.

- I was also thinking of adding various symbols to the index, and probably putting a table of symbols somewhere for reference (perhaps with page references to the points of first use).

- refer to pdfs too in mathematica notebooks index.

- Pillbox figure.  Perhaps make a first figure that doesn't have the integration volume, but does have the
  regions, and an illustration of each of fields (vector+bivector) in each region.

- "employ the mean value theorem" :

   statement about the mean value theorem is vague, and notation is not defined.

- Have places that it would make sense to use label boxes.  I'd forgotten all about those.

- before a \makedefinition, theorem, ... should I end any sentance?  I think so, and don't in many places.

- Is {eqn:isotropicMaxwells:520} the first use of \grad f = grad . f + I grad cross f?

(probably not: expect it's also in the Helmholtz content)

   This probably deserves some standalone discussion.

- Theorem 2.6: Line integral of a scalar function

   In proof of this theorem, the grade 2 component is ignored.  This probably deserves some thought and comment.
   Relation to vector curl in \R{3}?

- have now added a more complete proof of gagc up front.  Now need to streamline the surface and volume integral content.

- reciprocal frame: Alan:

   Better stated as a theorem. How do you know that there is a reciprocal frame? See my LAGA p. 94.

- Stated the fundamental theorm and stokes expicitly.  Under line, surface (and volume when done), go back and reference
  those theorem statements, covering just the differences from the general statement.

  Perhaps try a general proof of Stokes from the fundamental theorem, and get rid of the proofs for the special cases.

  May be able to get rid of the references to the distribution theorems used in the original Stokes' proof.  Will there
  be value keeping those?

- had used bigwedge notation in Stokes but don't think I defined it.  removed it ... search for other instances of this.

- add symbols to the index.

- Mo review:

The only thing missing is an explicit enumeration of the basis elements for the complete R^3 geometric algebra.  i.e.

1

e1, e2, e3

e_12, e_23, e_31

e_123


- Mo suggested 'is' instead of 'can be' in the bivector definition.  I use 'can be' many times, and
  something more definitive might be better.

- We don’t usually try to represent of a quantity that has the
apparent dimensions of a point graphically.

   >> not clear to mo.

-
      If you are inclined to skip this, please at least examine the
      stated dot product definition, since the conventional positive definite property is not assumed.

   >> perhaps eliminate this, since no non-Euclidean metric use has been introduced.

-

   There is no (concrete or CAS) worked example for _Integration with GA_ yet.
   I think you will think about it ;)
   Maybe there is a typical problem from a course for electro-engineers ?

- I've made right handed assumptions in my area and volume integral formulations.  Need to clarify those, or make a note to
  ensure that we pick a parameterization for which the hypervolume element is positive with respect to the standard basis.

- In general want to show connection between the area/volume element and jacobean.

   Did that for the specific case of spherical polar parameterization in R{3}.

   I agree.  I started out with something very informal, and I think I've gone too far in the opposite direction now.  I'll see if I can work on finding a better balance.


   > -- also using some free CAS like REDUCE, MAXIMA or EIGENMATH.

   This could activate the novice learner for keeping on the track ;)


   There are a number of GA CAS packages available in different languages.  Let me start with putting together an appendix listing some of the packages available, and giving examples of their use.
    
   MATHEMATICA is very good, but not free avaílable: my private version 4.0
   (1999)
   is very outdated. Maybe I can run your code, because you give txt-access to
   the *.m file.
    
   There are a few Mathematica GA packages available (mine, plus some others).  It's possible that one of the others will also work with Mathematica 4.  I like the integrated symbolic capability of Mathematica, and found that it justified the 'personal use licence' Mathematica purchase.  A full version for professional use is horrendously expensive.
