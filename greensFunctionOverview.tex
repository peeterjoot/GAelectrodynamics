\subsection{Motivation.}

%We will now introduce Green's functions, which provide a general method of solving many of the linear differential equations that will be encountered in electromagnetism.

\input{greensIntro.tex}

\subsubsection{Time domain problems in electromagnetism}
 
Examples of the PDEs that we can apply Green's function techniques to include

\begin{subequations}
\label{eqn:greensFunctionOverview:200}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:greensFunctionOverview:220}
\lr{ \spacegrad + \inv{c} \PD{t}{} } F(\Bx, t) = J(\Bx, t)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:greensFunctionOverview:162}
\lr{ \spacegrad^2 - \inv{c^2} \PDSq{t}{} } F(\Bx, t) =
\lr{ \spacegrad - \inv{c} \PD{t}{} }
\lr{ \spacegrad + \inv{c} \PD{t}{} } F(\Bx, t) =
B(\Bx, t).
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

The reader is no doubt familiar with the wave equation (\cref{eqn:greensFunctionOverview:162}), where \( F \) is the waving function, and \( B \) is the forcing function.
Scalar and vector valued wave equations are
encountered in scalar and vector forms in conventional electromagnetism.
We will see multivector variations of the wave equation, so it should be assumed that \( F \) and \( B \) are multivector valued.

\Cref{eqn:greensFunctionOverview:220} is actually the geometric algebra form of Maxwell's equation (singular),
where \( F \) is a 1,2 multivector, and \( J \) is a multivector containing all the charge and current density contributions.
We will call the operator in \cref{eqn:greensFunctionOverview:220} the spacetime gradient\footnote{A slightly different operator is also called the spacetime gradient in STA (Space Time Algebra) \citep{doran2003gap}, which employs a non-Euclidean basis to generate a four dimensional relativistic geometric algebra.
Our spacetime gradient is related to the STA spacetime gradient by a constant factor.}.


Armed with Fourier transform or phasor representations, the frequency domain representations of
\cref{eqn:greensFunctionOverview:200} are found to be

\index{Helmholtz operator}
\begin{subequations}
\label{eqn:greensFunctionOverview:320}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:greensFunctionOverview:240}
\lr{ \spacegrad + j k } F(\Bx) = J(\Bx)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:greensFunctionOverview:260}
\lr{ \spacegrad^2 + k^2 } F(\Bx)
=
\lr{ \spacegrad - j k } \lr{ \spacegrad + j k } F(\Bx)
= B(\Bx),
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

where \( k = \omega/c \), and any explicit frequency dependence in our transform pairs has been suppressed.
We will call these equations the first and second order Helmholtz equations respectively.
The first order equation applies a multivector differential operator to a multivector field, which must equal the multivector forcing function (the sources).

For statics problems (\( k = 0 \)), we may work with real fields and sources, dispensing with any need to take real parts.
