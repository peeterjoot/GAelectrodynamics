\maketheorem{Wave equation and continuity conditions.}{thm:continuity:600}{
The electromagnetic field is a solution to the non-homogeneous wave equation (\(\dAlembertian\): see \cref{dfn:continuity:120})
\begin{equation*}
%\lr{ \spacegrad^2 - \inv{c^2} \PDSq{t}{} }
\dAlembertian
F =
\conjstgrad J.
\end{equation*}
In source free conditions, this reduces to a homogeneous wave equation, with group velocity \( c \), the speed of the wave in the media.
When expanded explicitly in terms of electric and magnetic fields, and charge and current densities, this single equation resolves to a
non-homogeneous wave equation for each of the electric and magnetic fields
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
%\lr{ \spacegrad^2 - \inv{c^2} \PDSq{t}{} }
\dAlembertian
\BE
%&= \gpgrade{\conjstgrad J}{1}
&= \inv{\epsilon} \spacegrad \rho + \mu \PD{t}{\BJ} + \spacegrad \cross \BM \\
%\lr{ \spacegrad^2 - \inv{c^2} \PDSq{t}{} }
\dAlembertian
\BH
%&= \inv{I \eta} \gpgrade{\conjstgrad J}{2}
&= \inv{\mu} \spacegrad \rho_\txtm + \epsilon \PD{t}{\BM} - \spacegrad \cross \BJ,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
as well as a pair of continuity equations coupling the respective charge and current densities
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\spacegrad \cdot \BJ + \PD{t}{\rho} &= 0 \\
\spacegrad \cdot \BM + \PD{t}{\rho_\txtm} &= 0.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
